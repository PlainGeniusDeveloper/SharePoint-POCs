Subject: CMS Walkthrough Video Script – Request for Review

Email Body:

Dear [Reviewer’s Name],

I hope you're doing well.

As part of our upcoming CMS walkthrough video, I’ve drafted the complete script that outlines the objectives, user roles, content types, workflow, and publishing process. The intent is to help new and existing users understand how to use the CMS effectively, and how the content flows from creation to publication on the IT Service Portal.

I’ve attached the script for your review. Please take a look and let me know if you have any feedback, suggestions, or approvals before we proceed with recording and production.

Key areas covered in the script:

Why the CMS was built

System overview and access process

Creator and Approver roles

Supported content types (Product, Service, Platform)

WYSIWYG editor and content lifecycle

First-time publishing considerations

Content Explorer wizard

Final publishing on the IT Service Portal

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
