Yes, if you call await afterCompleted() at two different places, the afterCompleted() function will execute independently at both places, and the function will be called twice. This happens because await does not cache or share results of function calls; it simply waits for the current execution to complete.

Example of Function Being Called Twice

async function afterCompleted() {
    console.log("Executing afterCompleted...");
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Simulate a delay
    console.log("afterCompleted done!");
}

async function main() {
    console.log("Calling afterCompleted the first time...");
    await afterCompleted(); // First call
    console.log("First call completed.");

    console.log("Calling afterCompleted the second time...");
    await afterCompleted(); // Second call
    console.log("Second call completed.");
}

main();


---

Output:

Calling afterCompleted the first time...
Executing afterCompleted...
afterCompleted done!
First call completed.
Calling afterCompleted the second time...
Executing afterCompleted...
afterCompleted done!
Second call completed.

How to Prevent Multiple Calls

If you want the function to only execute once and reuse the result in subsequent calls, you can cache the result of the function using a variable or a flag.

Solution with Caching:

let afterCompletedPromise = null;

async function afterCompleted() {
    if (!afterCompletedPromise) {
        afterCompletedPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
            console.log("Executing afterCompleted...");
            setTimeout(() => {
                console.log("afterCompleted done!");
                resolve();
            }, 2000); // Simulated delay
        });
    }
    return afterCompletedPromise;
}

async function main() {
    console.log("Calling afterCompleted the first time...");
    await afterCompleted(); // First call
    console.log("First call completed.");

    console.log("Calling afterCompleted the second time...");
    await afterCompleted(); // Second call (cached result)
    console.log("Second call completed.");
}

main();

Updated Output (with Caching):

Calling afterCompleted the first time...
Executing afterCompleted...
afterCompleted done!
First call completed.
Calling afterCompleted the second time...
First call completed.
Second call completed.

Key Points:

1. Without Caching: The function will execute separately for each call.


2. With Caching: The result of the first execution is reused for subsequent calls, and the function runs only once.
