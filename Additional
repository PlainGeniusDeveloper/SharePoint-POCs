Across the organization, content is often created in scattered ways — with different teams using Confluence pages in inconsistent formats.

This makes it harder to find, understand, and maintain important information.

To solve this, we built a centralized CMS — a SharePoint-based single page application — where teams can create structured content using standard templates.

It supports role-based workflows for creators and approvers, and once approved, the content is automatically published to the IT Service Portal.

In short — content is created here, and consumed there.”
