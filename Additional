Subject: Request to Raise Ticket Post New System Rollout

Dear [Recipient's Name],

As discussed during our call, I have provided you with a demo of the new system. Since the rollout of the new system will take some time, I would like to kindly request you to raise a ticket once the new system is live.

The new platform will make it much easier for you to create and publish content efficiently.

Please feel free to reach out in case you need any further assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
