Subject: 🚀 Our New SharePoint CMS is Now Live!

Email Body:

Hi Team,

We’re excited to announce that our brand-new SharePoint-based CMS (Content Management System) is now officially live! 🎉

This modern, single-page application is designed to bring clarity, structure, and governance to how we create and manage IT-related content — replacing the chaos of scattered Confluence pages with a consistent, templated experience.

🔍 What’s New?

✨ Standardized templates for Product, Service, and Platform content

🧠 WYSIWYG editing — what you see is what you publish

✅ Role-based workflows for Creators and Approvers

🔔 Email notifications for review and approval

🔄 Auto-publishing to the IT Service Portal


🛠️ How to Get Started?

If you’re a new user, please raise a Jira request to get CMS access.
Once your profile is set up, you can begin creating and submitting content right away.

📝 Note: For first-time publishing, you’ll need to raise one more request to enable the content link on the IT Service Portal. For updates after that — content will auto-refresh within 24 hours.

🎥 Need a Demo?

A short walkthrough video is available [Insert Link] to guide you through every step.

Let’s make content creation easier, smarter, and faster — together!
