🎬 FULL VIDEO STORYBOARD – SharePoint CMS Single Page Application

(Slide-by-slide content with narration, on-screen text, visuals, and animation cues)

Slide 1 (0:00–0:10)
Title: Why was this CMS needed?
Voice-over: “Before we dive into how the system works, let’s understand *why* it was created.
In the current environment, most teams document their content on Confluence — but the information is scattered across multiple pages. Each user creates pages in their own format, which leads to inconsistency, confusion, and poor discoverability.”
On-screen: Screenshot of random Confluence pages, highlight inconsistent layouts

Slide 2 (0:10–0:20)
Title: The Solution – A Standardized CMS
Voice-over: “To solve this, we built a centralized, Single Page Application — on top of SharePoint.
This CMS provides standard templates for each content type — Product, Service, and Platform — ensuring every entry follows a predefined, readable, and user-friendly format.”
On-screen: SPA layout preview + three icons for Product / Service / Platform

Slide 3 (0:20–0:30)
Title: From CMS to IT Service Portal
Voice-over: “This CMS is only the authoring environment. Once content is created and approved, it gets published to the **IT Service Portal**, where end-users consume it.
So while CMS is for authors and approvers, the Service Portal is for content discovery and use.”
On-screen: Flow diagram: CMS → Approval → IT Service Portal

Slide 4 (0:30–0:38)
Title: System Overview
Voice-over: “This SPA on SharePoint supports structured content workflows, role-based control, and simple navigation across content types.
Pages may reload briefly, but the experience is seamless and consistent.”
On-screen bullets: SPA on SharePoint, Easy editing, Role-based visibility

Slide 5 (0:38–0:48)
Title: First-Time User Access
Voice-over: “New users begin by raising a Jira request. Once approved, the Support Team sets up their CMS account and role-based access.
Only then can they start creating content.”
On-screen: Flowchart – User → Jira Request → Support → CMS Access

Slide 6 (0:48–0:58)
Title: Understanding Roles
Voice-over: “There are two key roles — **Creator** and **Approver**.

On-screen: Creator: Draft → Submit | Approver: Review → Approve / Reject

Slide 7 (0:58–1:10)
Title: Content Types – Product, Service, Platform
