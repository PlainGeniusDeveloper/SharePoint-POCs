🎬 ULTRA-DETAILED VIDEO STORYBOARD – SharePoint CMS Single Page Application

Title: Why was this CMS built?
Voice-over (English):

"Before we dive into the process, let’s understand why this CMS was built in the first place.
Traditionally, teams documented their content on Confluence — but the information was scattered across multiple pages.
Each user followed their own structure and format, making it difficult to find or consume content consistently.
This made it hard to maintain clarity, governance, and discoverability."

🎬 Slide 2: The Solution – Standardized Content via CMS
Title: From Chaos to Clarity
Voice-over (English):

"With the new SharePoint CMS, we introduce standard templates for each content type — whether it's Product, Service, or Platform.
These templates ensure that every piece of content follows a predefined, readable, and user-friendly format.
This consistency makes it easier for both creators and consumers to manage, review, and understand the content — across teams, and across time."
